# Selenium-scraping-with-the-Geckodriver-and-firefox
The project is a display of how to scrape data from a website with the selenium geckodriver and firefox instead. 

This simple project is a follow up of an already existing project in a seperate repository here. This project has to do with scraping web information using firefox and the corresponding webdriver; Geckodriver. The former has to do with scraping with the chrome browser and its corresponding web driver; Chromedriver.

However, this project is labelled incomplete because it still contains some little unsolved bugs in the form exception, 'ElementNotInteractableException' to be precise, at the first line of the 'find_element' function, reason for this exception is known but underlying issue persists based on the use case website, in other words this repo will keep getting updated with time on the basis of trial and error solution that may surface. Any helping hand will definitely be appreciated
